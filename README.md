# Machine-Learning-Model-Comparison

Machine-Learning-Model-Comparison is a project that implements and compares different machine learning models to predict outcomes based on a given training dataset. The project involves data analysis, model training, prediction, and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Naive Bayes (NB). The repository includes the datasets used, the Jupyter notebooks for each model, and the resulting prediction files.

## Project Description

This project aims to provide a comprehensive comparison of different machine learning models for predicting outcomes on a dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training, prediction generation, and evaluation. The goal is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model and to identify the best-performing model and the best hyperparameters for the given dataset.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the training and test datasets.
- **Model Training:** Train various machine learning models (KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes) on the training dataset.
- **Prediction Generation:** Generate predictions for the test dataset using the trained models.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of each model and compare their results.
- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation of the steps and processes involved in the project.
